# PNG-Sequence-To-Animated-Webp
Bundled img2webp with this python script into an exe with a GUI to convert png sequences into webp file formats.

Future Plans: Update File browsing to allow mass drag & drop to run multiple file conversions at once instead of one by one --working on it



Just download the Webpify by Rish.exe file and run it.
